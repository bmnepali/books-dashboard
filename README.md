### Branch Structure (Git Workflow)
#### master : 
Where all our production ready project source code is stored. Mostly we dont touch this branch. Except for deployment.

#### staging: 
Where all our testing is done. Which means QA will use this branch for testing the solutions. After all things are ok, we merge staging in to master and deploy application. QA will only use this branch.

#### develop: 
Where our latest development code is kept. It holds the currently developed features after the Pull Request are approved by devs working on their separate feature branches.

#### feature-branch: 
It contains the task wise features developed by one or more developer. Which once approved will be merged into develop branch.
E.g: BDA-1001-some-awesome-feature (If you can reflect the task name as branch name, will be better!) But also remember your branch name mnust be concise and as sort as possible.
